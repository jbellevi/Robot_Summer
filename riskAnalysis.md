# Preliminary Risk Analysis
## Project risks
1. Not getting project done on time
  * Using a too complicated idea
      * Technically infeasible
      * Or, we do it but don't leave enough time for the rest
  * Fixating on ideas 
* Reducing scope too far (which lessens the capabilities of robot)

## Technical risks
1. Power consumption
  * Design demands more power than is available
2. Noise issues
  * We mess up circuit design and noise ends us
3. Can't pick up infinity stone
  * Too slow at picking up infinity stones
  * Difficulty aligning to pillar
  * Drop infinity stone once grabbed
4. Can't deposit infinity stone into gauntlet
  * Can't align to gauntlet
  * infinity stone slips out (stone put in at bad angle)
  * knock infinity stones out of gauntlet as we put them in
5. Not enough torque to go up ramp
6. Not fast enough to be competitive with best teams
7. Getting lost once having left the tape
8. Tape following doesn't work properly
9. Slippage leaves rotary sensors unreliable
10. Can't detect middle of post on infinity stone posts OR damage is done to either robot or stone positioning while going from top down
11. Can't store infinity stone on self
* Falls out
* We can't place it in


## Strategy risks
1. Competition with others teams: if we're not faster than they get more stones
2. Leaving return to gauntlet too late
3. Posts we've targeted are empty
