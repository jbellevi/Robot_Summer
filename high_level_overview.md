# High-level overview of Robot subsystems

## Mechanical
### Arm
* Sensors on arm to detect tape OR sensors on bottom of claw to detect top of pillar contact
* Options to raise: parallel motion, regular beam, elevator lift
### Claws
### Storage systems

#### Bumper
#### Electronic housing

## Power
### Powering motors
### Powering sensors
### Powering Bluepill

## Software
### Arm driver (includes claw driver)
### Driving and motion driver
### Sensor/Interrupt management (see sensor)

## Electrical
### Sensor
