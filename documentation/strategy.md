# Strategic Document: To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women

## Assumptions
* The better teams will collect 3 or more stones (6 - 8 points), 4-5 avengers (4 - 5 points), or 2-3 stones and a 1-2 avengers (5 - 8 points)
  * This rules out going only for avengers, if we intend to win
* So we'll assume no one will get more than 8 points
* Any team that can collect multiple stones in one run will beat teams that cannot
* We don't think that stealing will be a big problem. It may 


## Alternatives
### 1. Aim for infinity stones exclusively
* We would want to expect 3, stretch for 4
#### Advantages
* simpler to only pick up 1 thing
* has potential for as many points (realistically) as mixed strategy

#### Disadvantage
* If stones fall: Houston, we have a problem
* My guess would be that this is the main strategy, so more competition (hence the speed requirement)
* There's difficulty stone into gauntlet

#### What it entails
* We need a faster robot to get to stone first
* Fast motion, fast grabbing of stone (accurately and reliably)

2. Aim for avengers exclusively
#### Advantages
* Probably less competition
* Easier to grab and dump avengers probably

#### Disadvantages
* MAX 5 points
* Unreliable bc avengers could be Anywhere
* Currently no established sensing method (prob could sonar it, but sonars be Bad)

3. Aim for infinity stones first, with maybe a fun avenger thrown in
### Advantages
* Backup plan of sort, 

### Disadvantages
* makes for a tighter time constraint, and size constraint
* Might slow robot

### What it entails
* We need the claw to be able to fulfill multiple purposes, OR have 2 claws

### 4. Aim for avengers first, then 1 infinity  stone maybe
* NAH


# Conclusion of the strategy talk
**Primary goal:** Collect as many infinity stones as possible within time constraint, while maintaining the possibility of updating robot to get avengers (that might involve making sure the claw can work for both, adding detection)
**Secondary/stretch goal:** To make note of any avengers we see on the way out to infinity stones, and to be able to take those if something goes horribly wrong and the other team eats all the infinity stones we want
