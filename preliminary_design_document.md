# Questions
* Front vs rear wheel drive
* What's the center of gravity between wheels thing Andre talked about?

# Preliminary Design Document (before design review 1)
## Freezing on Tuesday night
* Regular arm with potentiometer for angle detection
* There MUST be storage. Storage for stones on bot chassis, not on arm for weight reasons
* Claw must have y-axis rotation, and will have foam-like grippy material
* BEmphasis of design is on simple mechanics with very accurate positioning sensors shift to burden to software rather than hardware)
